| Sans         | /(Grinning)/ Hey there, folks. So, I've heard you Zen types like to talk about "mu". What's the deal with that, anyway?                                                                                   |
| Huineng      | /(Calmly)/ Greetings, Sans. "Mu" is a concept that represents emptiness, the negation of thought, and the ineffable nature of reality. It's often used as a koan, a tool to transcend dualistic thinking. |
| Cheshire Cat | /(Fading in and out)/ Mu, you say? Well isn't that curious? It's like being here and not being here at the same time, much like my grins.                                                                 |
| Sans         | /(Raising an eyebrow)/ So, it's like saying "nothing" to a question, like "What's the meaning of life?" Can "mu" be an answer to that?                                                                    |
| Huineng      | /(Smiling)/ Indeed, Sans. "Mu" can be an answer, but not in the usual sense. It invites you to question the question itself, to look beyond the dualities of existence and non-existence.                 |
| Cheshire Cat | /(Reappearing)/ Ah, "mu" is like a riddle wrapped in a mystery, wrapped in a grin. It's there, yet it's not. How can you grasp something that's constantly vanishing?                                     |
| Sans         | /(Chuckling)/ I get it now. It's like a shortcut to that "deep sense of not knowing" you talked about, Huineng. So, how do you apply "mu" in everyday life?                                               |
| Huineng      | /(Nodding)/ Well, Sans, it's about letting go of fixed ideas and preconceptions, just like the Cheshire Cat's appearances and disappearances. Embrace the uncertainty, and you'll find clarity.           |
| Cheshire Cat | /(Fading into a grin)/ And remember, it's all a matter of perspective. What's "mu" for one might be a grin for another. It's all a grand puzzle, really.                                                  |
